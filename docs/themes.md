# Themes

The standard theme that comes with a new project is [hexojs/hexo-theme-landscape](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-landscape).

The standard way of installing a theme is by cloning the repo.

Example:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-landscape themes/landscape
```

The setup used for this quickstart project is submodules rather:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-landscape themes/landscape
```

See [submodules](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/38816f5a511b265eddaa60aa73362b04) guide.

Once the theme is in the repo, apply it in the [\_config.yml](/_config.yml) file.

e.g.

```yaml
theme: landscape
```
