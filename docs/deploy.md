# Deploy

Setup a deploy config file before running these commands - see [Resources](resources.md#deploy).


Deploy the built `public/` directory, if it exists.

```sh
$ yarn deploy
```

Clean, generate and then deploy. This is not a standard command but was added for convenience.

```sh
$ yarn deploy-full
```
